# Android-App "Verkehrsz√§hler mit Room" #

<br>

Simple Android app that demonstrates persistency with [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/) (Android's ORM) for a traffic counter app.

There is also a variant of this app which does use SQLite directly (i.e. does not use Room), see [this repository](https://github.com/MDecker-MobileComputing).
